# UI Design Rules

When working on React UI (components, feature UIs, pages):

- Follow `.github/rules/rules-design-ui.md` for visual style, UX, accessibility, and design-system usage.
- Keep new UI consistent with existing patterns and design tokens used in this repo.
- When unsure about trade-offs (e.g., spacing, typography, modal behavior), re-check this rule file before inventing a new pattern.
