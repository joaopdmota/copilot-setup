# TypeScript Technical Rules

When working in TypeScript files (`.ts` or `.tsx`):

- Treat `.github/rules/rules-tech-typescript.md` as the authoritative guide for typing, generics, and runtime validation.
- Prefer the `typescript-expert` skill from `.github/skills` for advanced typing and Zod usage.
- Avoid loosening types (e.g., using `any`) in ways that conflict with these rules.
