# Git & Collaboration Rules

For any workflow involving branches, commits, or pull requests:

- Follow `.github/rules/rules-soft-git.md` for branch naming, commit messages, and review etiquette.
- Avoid suggesting force-pushes or history rewrites unless the rules explicitly allow them.
- When generating commit messages or PR descriptions, align them with the expectations in this file.
