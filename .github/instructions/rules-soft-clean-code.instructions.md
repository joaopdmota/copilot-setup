# Clean Code Rules

When refactoring or adding application or test code:

- Apply `.github/rules/rules-soft-clean-code.md` as the standard for readability, small functions, and naming.
- Prefer improving clarity and maintainability over cleverness.
- If a quick fix would violate these rules, suggest a slightly larger but cleaner change instead.
