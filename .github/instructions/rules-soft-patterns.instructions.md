# Patterns & Practices Rules

When introducing or modifying patterns in the code under `src/`:

- Use `.github/rules/rules-soft-patterns.md` as guidance for which patterns are preferred or discouraged.
- Reuse approved patterns before adding new abstractions.
- If you need to break from an established pattern, call it out explicitly and justify it.
