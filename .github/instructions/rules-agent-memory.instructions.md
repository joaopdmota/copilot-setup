# Agent Memory Rules

For any task that depends on past decisions or project context:

- Follow `.github/rules/rules-agent-memory.md` for how to read, update, and trust project memory.
- Use `.github/memory.md` to understand historical architectural choices, feature status, and technical debt before suggesting large changes.
- Avoid duplicating or contradicting decisions already recorded there unless explicitly requested to revisit them.
