# React Technical Rules

When editing or creating React components in `.tsx` files:

- Follow `.github/rules/rules-tech-react.md` for component structure, hooks usage, list keys, and performance.
- Prefer the `react-expert` and `clean-code-expert` skills from `.github/skills` for deeper guidance.
- Align implementation details (state, effects, memoization) with these rules rather than generic React habits.
