# Golang Technical Rules

When editing or adding Go (`.go`) code:

- Follow `.github/rules/rules-tech-golang.md` for idiomatic Go, concurrency, error handling, and performance.
- Use the `golang-expert` skill from `.github/skills` as a playbook for implementation details.
- Keep new Go code consistent with patterns described in that rule file.
